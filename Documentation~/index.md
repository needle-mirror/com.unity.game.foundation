# Welcome to Game Foundation

Game Foundation delivers off-the-shelf common game systems to help you build games with Unity.
We aim to make these systems flexible and extensible.

Currently Game Foundation includes these game systems:

* An inventory system for defining and managing game resources that are inventoriable.
* A property system for defining and managing mutable fields that are commonly used in gameplay.
* A wallet system for defining and managing virtual currencies.
* A transaction system for handling virtual purchases / crafting mechanics and IAP purchases.
* A storefront system (with pre-made prefab UIs) for implementing a common in-game store.
* A data layer that helps with data persistence locally and remotely (coming soon).

We're working on adding more such pre-built common game systems over time to help developers spend less time on building these basic systems.
