# IAP Transactions

## Overview

An __IAP Transaction__ is a [catalog item] dedicated to In-App Purchasing.

This type of transaction shows 2 specifics fields:

- `Product Ids`: the identifiers of the products in the Platform Stores (Google Store and Apple App Store).
They are used by the IAP SDK through the [TransactionManager] to process the in-app purchase step.
- `Rewards`: it describes the outcome from the transaction, the list of items and currencies the player receives when processing this transaction.

## Editor Overview

Open the __Transaction__ window by going to __Window → Game Foundation → Transaction__.
The Transaction window will let you configure both [Virtual Transactions] and __IAP Transactions__).

The interface is similar to the other [catalog items editor].

(1) The Product IDs section allows the content creator to specify which product ids are linked to the transaction being edited.
  > **Tip:** Make sure to enter a product ID into both Apple and Google fields if you want to build for both platforms.

(2) The Rewards section shows a list of [currencies] and [item definitions].
  Those are the outcome of the transaction.
  The amounts next to each entry are the number of those items the player will get from the transaction.
