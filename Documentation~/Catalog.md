# The Game Foundation Database

## Overview

The __Game Foundation Database__ contains all the static data.
This data is grouped into different catalogs, each of them dealing with a kind of [catalog item].

A default database is created automatically when you open one of the Game Foundation windows, but you can also create your own using __Assets → Create → Game Foundation → Database__.

## Catalog Items

__[Catalog Items]__ are where data about the items are defined.
They are stored in their respective Game Foundation catalogs.

The current version of Game Foundation provides the following catalog item types:

- [Inventory Item Definition]
- [Currency]
- [Virtual Transaction]
- [IAP Transaction]
- [Store]
- [Tags]
- [Game Parameters]

__Catalog Items__ can be assigned [tags], properties and details.

## Editor Overview

Each catalog share the same editor layout.

(1) All catalog's items are listed on the left.
  Use the `+` button at the bottom to create a new one.

(2) The General section allows you to edit the Display Name of the item definition.
  The key is read-only. It can be set only at creation time.

(3) The [Tags] section is a widget which provides an intuitive way to assign [tags] to the edited item.  
  Start typing your tag, then select the proper one in the dynamically created list, or create a new one.

(4) Here are the sections specific to the type of edited catalog item. 

(5) In the **Static Properties** section you can define a list of fields for the catalog item to read at runtime.\
  A static property must define:
  - A value type. The current supported type are `long`, `double`, `bool` and `string`.
  - A unique key for you to access the property at runtime.
  - A value.

  Static Properties belong only to the definition they are declared into.
  This means you can use the same property key in different definitions with a different type if you want to.

(6) The [Details] section allows you to add custom static data to your item definition.
